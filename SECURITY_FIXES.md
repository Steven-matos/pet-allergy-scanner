# Security Fixes

## CVE-2024-23342: python-ecdsa Minerva Timing Attack (October 10, 2025)

### Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `python-ecdsa 0.19.1`
- **Advisory**: GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp
- **Severity**: High
- **Attack Vector**: Minerva timing attack on P-256 curve
- **Affected Operations**: `ecdsa.SigningKey.sign_digest()`, key generation, ECDH operations

### Impact Assessment
- **Direct Impact**: None - `python-ecdsa` was a transitive dependency via `python-jose`
- **Risk Level**: Low - Application uses HS256 (HMAC-SHA256), not ECDSA algorithms
- **Code Usage**: No direct usage of vulnerable ECDSA operations found

### Resolution
**Approach**: Eliminated the vulnerability by removing `python-jose` dependency

**Changes Made**:
1. Migrated JWT handling from `python-jose` to `PyJWT`
2. Updated `server/app/core/security/jwt_handler.py`:
   - Replaced `from jose import JWTError, jwt` with `import jwt`
   - Updated exception handling from `JWTError` to `InvalidTokenError`
   - Added explicit signature verification options
3. Removed `python-jose[cryptography]>=3.3.0` from `requirements.txt`
4. Upgraded `cryptography>=41.0.0` to `cryptography>=42.0.0`

### Testing Required
- [ ] JWT authentication with Supabase tokens
- [ ] JWT authentication with server-generated tokens
- [ ] Token expiration handling
- [ ] Invalid token rejection
- [ ] User lookup after token validation

### Deployment Steps
```bash
cd server
./scripts/fix-security-vulnerabilities.sh
```

### Verification
```bash
cd server
pip-audit
pytest tests/security/
```

## GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph: pip Vulnerability (October 10, 2025)

### Vulnerability Details
- **Package**: `pip 25.2`
- **Advisory**: GHSA-4xh5-x5gv-qwph
- **Impact**: Package installation security

### Resolution
Upgrade to latest secure pip version:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

## Security Best Practices Applied

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: JWT handling isolated in `jwt_handler.py`
- **Open/Closed**: JWT validation extensible without modifying core logic
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depends on PyJWT abstraction, not implementation details

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Eliminated duplicate JWT libraries (`python-jose` and `PyJWT`)
- Single source of truth for JWT operations

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- Simplified dependencies by using one JWT library
- Clearer error handling with PyJWT's native exceptions

### Defense in Depth
1. Use of industry-standard `cryptography` library
2. Explicit signature verification
3. Algorithm allowlisting (no "none" algorithm)
4. Audience and issuer validation
5. Regular security audits with `pip-audit`

## Future Security Monitoring

### Automated Checks
Add to CI/CD pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Security Audit
  run: |
    pip install pip-audit
    pip-audit --require-hashes --desc
```

### Dependency Updates
- Review security advisories monthly
- Test updates in staging before production
- Maintain `requirements-lock.txt` for reproducibility
