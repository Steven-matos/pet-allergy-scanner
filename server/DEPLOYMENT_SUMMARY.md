## 🚀 Next Steps (Choose One Path)

### Option A: Quick Deploy (5 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login
railway login

# 3. Initialize
cd server
railway init

# 4. Set variables (automated)
./railway-setup.sh

# 5. Deploy
railway up

# 6. Get URL
railway domain
```

### Option B: Web UI Deploy (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click "New Project" → "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Select this repository
5. Set root directory to `/server`
6. Add environment variables via web UI
7. Deploy automatically starts

## 📋 Post-Deployment Tasks

After deploying, you **must** update these:

### 1. Get Your Railway URL
```bash
railway domain
# Example: snifftest-production.up.railway.app
```

### 2. Update CORS Settings
```bash
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR="https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app,https://api.petallergyscanner.com,capacitor://localhost,sniffsafe://"

railway variables set ALLOWED_HOSTS_STR="YOUR-URL.up.railway.app,api.petallergyscanner.com"
```

### 3. Update iOS App
In your iOS project, update the API base URL:

**File**: `SniffTest/Shared/Services/APIService.swift` (or similar)

```swift
// Change from:
private let baseURL = "http://localhost:8000"

// To:
private let baseURL = "https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app"
```

### 4. Switch to Production APNs
```bash
railway variables set APNS_URL="https://api.push.apple.com"
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT="production"
railway variables set DEBUG="false"
```

### 5. Test Your API
```bash
# Health check
curl https://YOUR-URL.up.railway.app/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": {
    "status": "connected",
    ...
  },
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## 🔍 Quick Commands Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Deploy | `railway up` |
| View logs | `railway logs` |
| Get URL | `railway domain` |
| Set variable | `railway variables set KEY=value` |
| Check status | `railway status` |

## 💰 Expected Costs

- **Development/Testing**: $5/month (Railway credit)
- **Production (low traffic)**: $5-10/month
- **Production (medium traffic)**: $10-20/month
- **Production (high traffic)**: $20-50/month

Monitor costs: `railway usage`

## 🛡️ Security Checklist

Before going to production:

- [x] All environment variables configured
- [x] APNs certificate secured (.gitignore)
- [x] .env file excluded from git
- [ ] Update `DEBUG=false` for production
- [ ] Update `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Update `APNS_URL` to production
- [ ] Configure CORS with actual domains
- [ ] Set up custom domain (optional)
- [ ] Enable Railway monitoring
- [ ] Test all API endpoints

2. **RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md** - Comprehensive deployment guide
3. **README.md** - Full project documentation
4. **env.example** - Environment variable template

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Run Pre-Deployment Check
```bash
python3 check-deployment-ready.py
```

### Common Issues

**Railway CLI not found?**
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
# or
brew install railway
```

**Environment variables not loading?**
```bash
# Use the automated script
./railway-setup.sh

# Or verify manually
railway variables
```

**CORS errors after deployment?**
```bash
# Update CORS with your Railway URL
railway variables set ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR="https://your-url.up.railway.app,..."
```

**Database connection failing?**
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct
- Check Supabase allows Railway IP ranges (usually auto)
