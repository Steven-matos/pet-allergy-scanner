# üéâ Railway Deployment Successful!

## Live API URL
**Production:** [https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app](https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app)

## ‚úÖ Verified Working

### Health Check Endpoint
```bash
curl https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app/health
```

**Response:**
```json
{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","service":"SniffTest API"}
```

‚úÖ API is responding correctly
‚úÖ Health endpoint working
‚úÖ Database connection established
‚úÖ All environment variables configured properly

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Healthcheck Timeout Issue**
- **Problem:** Original 300s timeout was too short for Railway's deployment process
- **Solution:** Increased to 600s (10 minutes) timeout
- **Result:** Healthcheck now passes consistently

### 2. **Logging Configuration**
- **Fixed:** Python logging to use `stdout` instead of `stderr`
- **Result:** Logs show at correct levels in Railway dashboard

### 3. **Pydantic V2 Configuration**
- **Fixed:** Updated to use `ConfigDict` with `populate_by_name=True`
- **Result:** No more Pydantic warnings

### 4. **Requirements Cleanup**
- **Fixed:** Removed duplicate `httpx` entry
- **Result:** Clean, organized dependencies

### 5. **Graceful Startup**
- **Fixed:** App starts even if database connection fails initially
- **Result:** More resilient deployment process

### 6. **Diagnostic Startup Script**
- **Created:** `railway_start.py` with detailed validation
- **Result:** Clear error messages if issues occur

## Configuration Files

### `railway.toml` (Primary Config)
```toml
[build]
builder = "RAILPACK"
buildCommand = "pip install -r requirements-lock.txt"

[deploy]
startCommand = "python3 railway_start.py"
healthcheckPath = "/health"
healthcheckTimeout = 600
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 3

[env]
PYTHONUNBUFFERED = "1"
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE = "1"
ENVIRONMENT = "production"
```

### Environment Variables Set
- ‚úÖ ENVIRONMENT=production
- ‚úÖ SECRET_KEY (32+ characters)
- ‚úÖ SUPABASE_URL
- ‚úÖ SUPABASE_KEY
- ‚úÖ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- ‚úÖ SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET
- ‚úÖ DATABASE_URL

---

## API Endpoints

### Base URL
```
https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app
```

### Available Endpoints
- `GET /` - API info
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/v1/monitoring/health` - Detailed health check
- `POST /api/v1/auth/*` - Authentication endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/v1/pets/*` - Pet management
- `GET/POST /api/v1/scans/*` - Scanning functionality
- `GET /api/v1/ingredients/*` - Ingredient analysis
- And more...

### Testing Your API

```bash
# Health check
curl https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app/health

# API info
curl https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app/

# With authentication (replace YOUR_TOKEN)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app/api/v1/pets
```

---

## iOS App Integration

Update your iOS app to use the Railway URL:

**In your app configuration:**
```swift
// Replace your API base URL
let apiBaseURL = "https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app"
```

Test the connection from your app to verify everything works!

---

## Deployment Workflow

### Current Setup
1. Push to `main` branch
2. Railway automatically detects changes
3. Builds using Railpack
4. Installs dependencies from `requirements-lock.txt`
5. Runs `railway_start.py`
6. Performs health check at `/health`
7. Deploys if healthy ‚úÖ

### Manual Deploy
```bash
railway up
```

### View Logs
```bash
railway logs --follow
```

### Rollback if Needed
```bash
railway rollback
```

---

## Monitoring

### Railway Dashboard
- **Metrics:** CPU, Memory, Network usage
- **Logs:** Real-time application logs
- **Deployments:** History and status
- **Settings:** Environment variables

### Health Check Monitoring
Railway automatically monitors `/health` endpoint every few seconds and will restart the service if it becomes unhealthy.

---

## Performance Tips

### Current Configuration
- ‚úÖ Using `requirements-lock.txt` for consistent builds
- ‚úÖ Python 3.13.8 (latest)
- ‚úÖ GZIP compression enabled
- ‚úÖ Connection pooling configured
- ‚úÖ Async database operations

### Recommended Additions (Future)
- [ ] Set up Railway Redis for caching
- [ ] Configure CDN for static assets
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerting (e.g., Sentry)
- [ ] Set up custom domain
- [ ] Configure backup strategy

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Test locally: `python3 railway_start.py`
4. Check for Pydantic validation errors

### If Health Check Fails
1. Test endpoint manually: `curl https://snifftest-api-production.up.railway.app/health`
2. Check logs for startup errors
3. Verify database connection
4. Increase healthcheck timeout if needed

### If App is Slow
1. Check Railway metrics for resource usage
2. Review database query performance
3. Enable caching for frequently accessed data
4. Consider upgrading Railway plan

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. ‚úÖ **Update iOS app** with Railway URL
2. ‚úÖ **Test all endpoints** from your app
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Set up custom domain** (optional)
   - Go to Railway Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your domain and configure DNS
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Configure monitoring** (recommended)
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
   - Configure uptime monitoring
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Update CORS origins** for production frontend
   - Add your production domains to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS_STR`
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Review rate limits** for production traffic
   - Adjust `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` if needed
