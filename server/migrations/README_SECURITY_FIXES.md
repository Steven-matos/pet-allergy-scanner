# Security Fixes for Supabase Warnings

## Function Search Path Security

### What was the issue?
Functions with `SECURITY DEFINER` that don't have an explicit `search_path` set are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Attackers could manipulate the search path to execute malicious code.

### What was fixed?
Added `SET search_path = public, auth` to all affected functions:
- `validate_username_unique`
- `sync_username_to_public_users`
- `handle_new_user`
- `handle_user_update`

### How to apply the fix:
1. Run the migration: `fix_function_search_path_security.sql`
2. Verify in Supabase SQL Editor that functions now have search_path set
3. Check Security Advisor - warnings should be resolved

## Leaked Password Protection

### What is it?
Supabase Auth can check passwords against HaveIBeenPwned.org's database of compromised passwords, preventing users from using passwords that have been leaked in data breaches.

### How to enable:

#### Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended):
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Policies** → **Password**
3. Enable **"Leaked Password Protection"**
4. Save changes

#### Via API (Alternative):
```bash
curl -X PATCH 'https://your-project.supabase.co/auth/v1/admin/config' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "password": {
      "hibp_enabled": true
    }
  }'
```

### Benefits:
- Prevents users from using compromised passwords
- Enhances overall account security
- Reduces risk of credential stuffing attacks
- No impact on user experience (only blocks known compromised passwords)

### Testing:
After enabling, try creating an account with a known compromised password like "password123" - it should be rejected.

## Security Best Practices Applied:

1. **SOLID**: Single Responsibility - each function has one clear purpose
2. **DRY**: Functions are reusable across triggers
3. **KISS**: Simple, clear security configurations
4. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (RLS, search_path, password protection)

## Verification Checklist:

- [ ] Run `fix_function_search_path_security.sql` migration
- [ ] Verify all 4 function warnings are resolved in Security Advisor
- [ ] Enable Leaked Password Protection in Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] Test authentication flow still works correctly
- [ ] Verify password policy rejects compromised passwords
